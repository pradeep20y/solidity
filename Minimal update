i learned about chain link keeper functionality.
it is used for auto triggering of smart contract upon the
given condition.

eg :
time based triggering.
contract should first be compatible with the keeper function
certain interface must be imported and inherited in the contract.
checkupkeeper and performupkeeper function is used from the interface.
checkupkeeper tell if the logic in the performupkeeper can be executed or not.

The smart contract address is registered on the chain link
keeper application

i am not going count today and tomorrow since my semester
exams are on. Minimal updates will be made at the least.
