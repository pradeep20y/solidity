Today i learned to interact with the backend using the frontend.
backend - FundMe contract using Foundry(Forge)
Frontend - HTML/JAVA SCRIPT(ether.js)

Instead of implemented a series of command in the terminal, all the commands can be executed in a single go using the Markfile. 

Metamask injects ethereum object in the browser. It is then used for sending and receiving transaction in the blockchain.

The below code is deployed in local network (anvil).
1. Metamask is configured with the anvil RPC and the account is imported using private key.
2. Deployed contract in the network(anvil).
3. Deployed contract address is pasted along with its API in the contract.js
4. Using the provider(RPC) and the signer(User) , the transaction is processed in the local newtwork.


fund function (javascript example)
-------------

async function fund() {
  const ethAmount = document.getElementById("ethAmount").value             // gets the amount from the input
  console.log(`Funding with ${ethAmount}...`)
  if (typeof window.ethereum !== "undefined") {                            // checks if the meta wallet is connected
    const provider = new ethers.BrowserProvider(window.ethereum)           // Fetches the RPC of the local network from the meta-wallet
    await provider.send('eth_requestAccounts', [])                         // Sends the transaction request to the metamask account 
    const signer = await provider.getSigner()                              // retrieves the active Ethereum account from the user's wallet and allows signing transactions
    const contract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, abi, signer)     // instantiate the contract with its abi and the signer
    try { 
      const transactionResponse = await contract.fund({                    // Sends transaction to the contract 
        value: ethers.parseEther(ethAmount),
      })
      await transactionResponse.wait(1)                                    // Wait for the transaction to mined.
    } catch (error) {
      console.log(error)
    }
  } else {
    fundButton.innerHTML = "Please install MetaMask"
  }
}
